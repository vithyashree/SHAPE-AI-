be a difficult one. The purpose of this publication is to
provide adult leaders of youth programs with a step by

          <h1>WHAT IS LEADERSHIP?</h1>
          <p>Social psychologists provide many different
definitions. Most say that leadership involves the
interaction of leaders, followers and goals.
Leaders need followers who are willing to use the
talents of the group and respect their opinions.
Together, leaders and followers must determine
the goals and decide on the course of action needed to
accomplish them.
Are leaders born or made? Some people believe
that leaders are born into leadership positions by their
inheritance and destiny. Others believe that it takes a
special situation for a person to achieve a leadership
position. When working with youth, we need to believe
that each individual has the capacity to lead. Who will
lead depends on the membership of the group and the
demands of the goal to be accomplished.
Each individual has their own leadership style.
Youth will also develop a style unique to them. Some
leaders take charge of the followers and give orders on
what needs to be accomplished. Other leaders listen to
the followers and together decide on a goal and how it
should be accomplished.
Youth organizations provide many different opportunities for youth to develop and practice their leadership skills and styles. These include serving on a committee, being a club officer, planning an event, speaking in
front of groups or networking with other organizations.
Providing training for youth who serve in these leadership capacities is essential so that youth feel confident in
fulfilling the challenges required of them. Once they
have achieved a measure of success, youth will continue
to strive for more demanding and difficult roles.

            <h1>POINTS TO CONSIDER FOR EFFECTIVE
LEADERSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMS</h1>
<p>
  When designing an effective leadership training
program for youth, consider the following:
Know Where The Youth Are Developmentally
Adolescence is a period when youth are establishing a sense of personal identity. They are learning to be
goal directed and principle–oriented rather than parent
directed and feeling–oriented. During adolescence,
family ties are growing weaker and peers are becoming
more important.
At this time, adolescents are also developing the
ability to see things from another’s point of view and
developing a commitment to a system of values. Youth
are learning to make more decisions and take on more
responsibilities. They lack experience in dealing with
this new independence.
Help Build Self Esteem
Each youth develops a sense of his or her identity
that is unique from everyone else. This identity can best
be found in interaction with significant other people.
Adolescents need to know that they have special talents
that are unique to them. By helping them develop a
positive self image, they will have the confidence
needed to meet the demands of leadership.
Provide a Nonthreating Atmosphere
Youth need to feel comfortable in participating in
scheduled activities and in voicing their opinions. One
of the first activities should be one in which members
of the group can get to know one another. This will
help set the pace for the rest of the training program.
Help Youth Build Social Skills Trough Group
Activities
Leaders need to know how to communicate with
their followers. This includes talking with the group
members, listening to their ideas and concerns, and
reading their reactions through non–verbal communications. Youth should be given opportunities to practice
these communication skills.
Provide Opportunities For Different Youth to
Emerge as the Leader
In order to provide leadership training for youth,
each individual needs to have the opportunity to
experience the leader role. At times, one person in the
group may dominate and not let others have the
experience of leading the group. Program planners
should make an effort to see that each participant has
his or her turn at being the leaders
